# Change Client Reference Dates

**Page Type:** Utility/Tool (URL: [https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/adminclientreferencedates](https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/adminclientreferencedates)) <!--style: Subtitle -->

This utility changes the **Reference Date** on multiple Client records in a single action. Client records are specified by a comma-separated list of Client IDs.

```admonish note
The **Reference Date** in a record is used to determine which options should be displayed in each Dropdown field. When a record is created, its Reference Date is set to Creation Date (Client) or Date Opened (SR, Project).

Options that are Active on the Reference Date of a record will display.
```
