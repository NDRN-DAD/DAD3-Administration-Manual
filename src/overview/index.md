# DAD 3.0 Administration Manual Overview

The Disability Advocacy Database (DAD) is a fully accessible, web-based data collection and management system developed by the Protection and Advocacy Network specifically for P&A/CAP programs. What started as a unified way to collect Program Performance Report (PPR) data across funding sources has now evolved into an office wide tool that includes timekeeping features and fund allocation capabilities to meet the unique needs of the P&A/CAP programs.

DAD has also stayed true to its original intent for creation of assisting P&A/CAP programs with completing PPRs for federal grants and contracts. Data collection fields and settings are adjusted as needed to accommodate changes to federal data collection requirements, and report templates updated by NDRN annually for use in completing PPRs.

This manual is intended for DAD Administrators. Non-admin users should refer to the DAD 3.0 User Support site.
