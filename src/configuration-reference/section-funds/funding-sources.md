## About Funding Sources

In DAD 3, the configuration settings for a funding source can be viewed and edited in a single form. Each form tab contains associations for each record type. 

By default, only active associations/options are displayed in the Funding Sources table. The section of Filters above the table can be modified to show Inactive or All options for each assocatied field. To hide (collapse) the Filters section from your display, click the "Filters" heading.

The basic settings for each funding source are displayed by default in the Funding Sources table. An expanded entry (viewed by clicking the "+" icon next to an entry or clicking "Expand All") reveals cards that list the options for each associated field.

```admonish important
Use caution when editing associations. To avoid creating end user validation errors and warnings, you should not unassociate options that have been used in existing records; instead you should make obsolete options inactive by entering an Inactive Date equal to the end of the prior reporting period.
```
