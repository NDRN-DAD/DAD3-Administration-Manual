# Zip Codes

**Page Type:** Table with Import option (URL: [https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplayzipcodes](https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplayzipcodes)) <!--style: Subtitle -->

Zip Code settings are used with the **Lookup City/State** function to auto-populate City, State, County and Location information in Client and Contact records. Agencies can import multiple entries into this table using the **Import Zip Codes** function.

```admonish info
If a user looks up a zip code that matches more than one entry in this table (i.e. two or more cities fall under a single zip code), an additional dialog will appear prompting the user to select the correct city.
```
