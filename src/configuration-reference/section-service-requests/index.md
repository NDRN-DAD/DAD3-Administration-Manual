# Section: Service Requests

The Service Request Section contains utilities and tables of options for fields used primarily in Service Request records. This section also includes settings for **Facilities**, **Publications**, **Notes**, **Attachments**, and **Appointments**. 

```admonish note
 With the exception of Service Request Types that are essential for PPR reporting, the settings in this section are unique to each Advocacy Group and can be customized as desired.
