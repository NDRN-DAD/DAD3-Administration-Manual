# Appendix A: Permissions Reference

In **Security Groups administration**, all permissions are listed **alphabetically**. You can type into the **search filter** to narrow the list to permissions of a certain type (for example, `appointment`, `attachment`, or `time`).

The tables below group permissions by record type or function and explain what granting each permission allows a user to do.

```admonish important
**Permissions are additive.** Users receive every permission included in each role they are assigned. Roles only grant privileges; they do not override or take away permissions granted by other roles.
```
