# Outcome Statements

**Page Type:** Table (URL: [https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplayadvoutcomes](https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplayadvoutcomes)) <!--style: Subtitle -->


_Has Field Mapping_ / **Associated Record Types:** [Funding Sources](funding-sources.md), [Problems](problems.md)

Outcome Statements are options used to track case outcome information when closing a Service Request with a PABSS, PAIMI or CAP funding source, for reporting purposes. **Mapped Outcome Statement** selections reflect the federally reportable options for these funding sources. Agencies may modify Outcome Statement selections that end users see if desired. For accurate reporting, each mapped Outcome Statement must have at least one active selection mapped to it for each applicable Funding Source.

```admonish tip
Historically, reportable Outcomes Statements differed depending on the case Problem Area. Because federal reporting reqirements have since changed, it is no longer necessary to restrict selections based on Problem. Simply **Select All** when associating **Problems** with **Outcome Statements**.
