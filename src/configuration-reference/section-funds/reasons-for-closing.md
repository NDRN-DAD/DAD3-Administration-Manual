_Has Field Mapping_ / **Associated Record Types:** [Funding Sources](funding-sources.md), [Service Request Types](../section-service-requests/service-request-types.md) (Service Requests)

Reasons for Closing are options used when closing a Service Request or Project, for reporting purposes. **Mapped Reason for Closing** selections reflect the federally reportable options for all funding sources. For accurate reporting, each mapped Reason for Closing must have at least one active selection mapped to it for each applicable Funding Source.

Unlike Intervention Strategy and Outcome Statement, Reason for Closing is used for reporting on **all** Service Request Types, not just Case Services.
