# Priorities

**Page Type:** Table (URL: [https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplaypriorities](https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplaypriorities)) <!--style: Subtitle -->

**Associated Record Types:** [Objectives](objectives.md)

Each Priority (*Goal* in the OnePPR) can have one of more Objectives (*Priorities* in the OnePPR) associated with it (similar to Problem/Subproblem pairs). Each Priority/Objective pair is associated with Funding Sources, Service Request Types, Project Types, and Actions (used in Timekeeping).

```admonish caution
Use caution in updating Priorities and Objectives to avoid creating validation warnings or errors on older records. In most cases, you should avoid removing any associations that has been in use. Instead, enter a September 30 Inactive Date for selections no longer in use, and create new selections with an Active Date of October 1.
```
```admonish tip
To ensure that updates to Priorities and Objectives are reflected in service requests and projects carried over from the prior fisccal year, change the reference dates of all carryover records to October 1 of the new Fiscal Year *after* reporting for the prior fiscal year has been completed (see [Change Service Request Reference Dates](../section-service-requests/change-service-request-reference-dates.md) and [Change Project Reference Dates](../section-projects/change-project-reference-dates.md))
```
