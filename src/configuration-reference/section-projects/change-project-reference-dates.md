# Change Project Reference Dates

This utility changes the **Reference Date** on multiple Project records in a single action. Projects are specified by a comma-separated list of Project IDs.

```admonish note
The **Reference Date** in a record is used to determine which options should be displayed in each Dropdown field. When a record is created, its Reference Date is set to Creation Date (Client) or Date Opened (SR, Project).

Only options that are Active on the Reference Date of a record will display.
```
