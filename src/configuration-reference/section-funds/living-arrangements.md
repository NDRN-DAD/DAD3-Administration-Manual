_Has Field Mapping_ / **Associated Record Types:** [Funding Sources](funding-sources.md)

Living Arrangements are options used to track a Client's living arrangement and reporting purposes. **Mapped Living Arrangement** selections reflect the federally reportable options for all funding sources. For accurate reporting, each mapped Living Arrangement must have at least one active selection mapped to it, and all Living Arrangaments must be associated with the proper funding sources based on reporting requirements.

In the Client Record, a Living Arrangement can be selected from the list of all active Living Arrangaments. When a  Service Request is created for the client, the Client's Living Arranagement will be auitomatically copies to the Service Request Living Arrnagement **if** that Living Arranagement is associated with the Service Request's funding source. A Service Request Living Arrangement may differ from the Client Living Arrangement in cases where the client is residing in multiple sor temporary settings, or if the Client Living Arrnagement is not an option for the Service Request's funding source.

Options: Is the Default Option, Is a Facility, Use with Clients and Service Requests, Use with Projects
