# Positions

**Page Type:** Table (URL: [https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplayadvpositions](https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplayadvpositions)) <!--style: Subtitle -->

Positions are agency-defined options for User records. Position information for a User can be accessed with the Report Generator, making it a useful field for organizing and managing an agency's users.

As with most DAD Administration settings pages of this type, operations include: **Add Position** button to add a new entry, **Edit** and **Delete** buttons for exisiting entries, and **Export to Excel** button to export the settings to a file.

This screenshot contains examples of position names agencies might use:
