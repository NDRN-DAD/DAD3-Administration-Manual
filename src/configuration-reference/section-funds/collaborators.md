_Has Field Mapping_ / **Associated Record Types:** [Collaborations](collaborations.md)

Collaborators and Collaborations are used in DAD to track activities involving collaboration with other agencies and entities. The OnePPR requires reporting on these collaborations, including details on collaboration with certain types of entities (reflected in the Mapped Collaborators selections). Project records can have one or more Collaborations selected. Each Collaboration can consist of one or more Collaborators.

Collaborators and Collaborations can be entered and maintained by a DAD Administrator **or** by a User with the **Edit: Collaborations** permission granted.

Collaborators are entered on this page, and can be associated with exisitng Collaborations. To create a _new_ Collaboration, go to the **Collaborations** page.

Operations available on this page include: 
- **Add Collaborator** button to add a new entry
- **Edit** and **Delete** buttons for exisiting entries
- **Expand All** and **Collapse All** buttons to show or hide Associated Collaborations, and
- **Export to Excel** button to export these settings to a file

```admonish tip
To export the Collaborations for each Collaborator, they must be displayed as a column. Before exporting, edit the Columns settings and select **Collaborations** for display.
```
