# New Form Experience

In DAD 3.0 Administration settings, associations between different types of fields are integrated directly into the New/Edit forms for each item. Each associated field is displayed as an additional form tab.

**This ****new ****interface**** allows users to create and update new items in a single ****form, and**** significantly improves ease of use and efficiency in database administration functions**** compared to DAD 2.0****.**
