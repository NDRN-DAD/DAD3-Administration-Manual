# Section: Priorities & Objectives

Priorities and Objectives are agency-defined options used to catgerorize service requests and projects for federal reporting purposes. Most of the federal funding sources require agencies to set Priorities and Objectives (called "Goals and Priorities" in the OnePPR). When agencies change their Priorities and Objectives, these changes in DAD are made effective as of October 1 of the new fiscal year.

Each Priority (*Goal* in the OnePPR) can have one of more Objectives (*Priorities* in the OnePPR) associated with it (similar to Problem/Subproblem pairs). Each Priority/Objective pair is associated with Funding Sources, Service Request Types, Project Types, and Actions (used in Timekeeping).

When a Priority has *multiple* Objectives, it should also be associated with the default Objective (e.g. Not Selected). This allows the Objective dropdown selection to function correctly.

```admonish caution
Use caution in updating Priorities and Objectives to avoid creating validation warnings or errors on older records. In most cases, you should avoid removing any associations that has been in use. Instead, enter a September 30 Inactive Date for selections no longer in use, and create new selections with an Active Date of October 1.
```
```admonish tip
To ensure that updates to Priorities and Objectives are reflected in service requests and projects carried over from the prior fiscal year, change the reference dates of all carryover records to October 1 of the new Fiscal Year *after* reporting for the prior fiscal year has been completed (see [Change Service Request Reference Dates](../section-service-requests/change-service-request-reference-dates.md) and [Change Project Reference Dates](../section-projects/change-project-reference-dates.md))
