# Section: Local Data

Local Data Fields are custom fields that agencies can create to track additional information that is not built in to DAD. Local Data fields can be created for Client, Service Request, and Project records. This is a powerful feature that can be used to adapt DAD for non P&A/CAP funding sources and to collect additional information of interest to your advvocacy group.

For example, an Advocacy group that wants to track how many veterans it serves could add a local data field labeled *Is a Veteran* to their Client records.

Local Data Fields are associated with several other fields (Funds, SR Types, Project Types, Problem/Subproblem). Each association can be "Not Specific" (meaning the Local Data Field will be displayed for records of all Funds/SR Types, etc.), or a selection items.
