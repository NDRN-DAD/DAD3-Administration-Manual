# Change Service Request Reference Dates

**Page Type:** Utility/Tool (URL: [https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/adminservicerequestreferencedates](https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/adminservicerequestreferencedates)) <!--style: Subtitle -->


This utility changes the **Reference Date** on multiple Service Request records in a single action. Service Request records are specified by a comma-separated list of Service Request IDs.

```admonish note
The **Reference Date** in a record is used to determine which options should be displayed in each Dropdown field. When a record is created, its Reference Date is set to Creation Date (Client) or Date Opened (SR, Project).

Only options that are Active on the Reference Date of a record will display.
```
