# Deleted Entities Log

**Page Type:** Table (URL: [https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplaydeletedentities](https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplaydeletedentities)) <!--style: Subtitle -->



When a record (Client, Service Request or Project), is deleted in DAD 3.0, the contents of the deleted record is added to this log (in Json format – expand the table entry to view this content), along with **Date Deleted** and **Deleted by User** fields for audit purposes.

Note: Prior to DAD 3.0, deleted record information and contents were contained in the body of an Email Notification (to recipients specified in Administration > General > Email Notifications).
