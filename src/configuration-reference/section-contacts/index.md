# Section: Contacts

Contacts are records of individuals and other entities (agencies, organizations, etc.) that are associated with one or more records (Clients, Service Requests or Projects). Users can add one or more contacts when creating a new record, or they can be added to existing records.

```admonish info
When creating a Contact, a user is first prompted to search existing Contact records (including Clients) to see if the Contact already exists in DAD. It is usually advisable to select (and update) the existing Contact record rather than creating a duplicate Contact. Agency polcies may vary on Contact creation.
```

Agencies can add and modify the options for **Contact Type**, **Guardian Type** (for Contact Type(s) mapped to Guardian), **Organization Type** (for Organizational Contacts), and **Relationships** dropdowns.

The **Zip Codes** settings page is also located in the Contacts section. These settings are used with the "Lookup Zip" function to auto-populate City, State, County and Location information in Client and Contact records.
