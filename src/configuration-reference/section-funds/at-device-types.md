# AT Device Types

**Page Type:** Table (URL: [https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplayadvatdevicetypes](https://dad3.ndrn.org/admin/admindisplayadvatdevicetypes)) <!--style: Subtitle -->



_Has Field Mapping_ / **Associated Record Types:** [Funding Sources](funding-sources.md)

AT Device Types are options used to track AT devices and services received as a result of PAAT-funded services, for reporting purposes. **Mapped AT Device Type** selections reflect the federally reportable options. Agencies may modify the AT Device Types that end users see and add additional types if desired. For accurate reporting, each mapped AT Device Type must have at least one active selection mapped to it.

AT Device Types can only be associated with funding sources that are mapped to PAAT. For most agencies, this means that PAAT will be the only Funding Source displayed on the Funds tab.
